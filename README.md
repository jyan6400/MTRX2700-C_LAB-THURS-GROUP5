## Project Description
This project is a series of embedded system modules programmed in **C** for the **STM32F3 Discovery Board**. It was completed over Weeks 6–8 as part of the MTRX2700 C Lab Series.

The goal is to demonstrate modular, low-level embedded development using:
- Manual memory management and pointer logic
- LED and button I/O interaction
- Serial communication (UART)
- Hardware timers and delay functions
- Integration of all components into a working system
