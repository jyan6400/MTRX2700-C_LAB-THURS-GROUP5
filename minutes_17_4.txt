# 📝 Integration Task – Group Meeting Minutes (Integration Debugging & Final Testing)

**Date:** 17 April 2025  
**Attendees:** Jason, Saksham, Shirui  
**Project:** CLAB Exercise 4 – Final Integration  
**Minutes file:** `minutes/minutes_17_4.txt`

---

## 1. Objective

To complete final debugging and full-system testing for Exercise 4 Integration. This includes ensuring the correct execution of all command inputs (`led`, `serial`, `oneshot`, `timer`), functional LED display and timer behavior, and validation of button-triggered events before Week 8 presentation.

## 2. Final Testing Summary

| Component                                | Test Performed                                                | Result  | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UART command → LED pattern               | Input `led 11001100#` displays correct pattern on PE8–PE15     | ✅      | LED positions verified left to right (PE15 = index 0)                |
| UART command → echo string               | `serial Hello World#` echoes message with correct formatting   | ✅      | Handles null argument and spacing edge cases                         |
| UART command → `oneshot 500#`            | Flashes all LEDs once after 500 ms                             | ✅      | Uses TIM2 one-shot mode with correct timing                          |
| UART command → `timer 1000#`             | LEDs blink in 1s intervals                                     | ✅      | Conflicts avoided using `timer_stop()` before start                  |
| Button press → trigger callback          | EXTI0 triggers ISR; ready for user-defined action              | ✅      | Debounced and tested manually                                        |
| Simultaneous command execution           | Stress test with multiple commands in sequence                 | ✅      | No crashes or overlap; buffers cleared between calls                 |
| Edge-case input (e.g. `led 1234#`)       | Handled with error message and ignored                         | ✅      | Input validation logic working as expected                           |

## 3. Final Repository Updates

| Folder     | Updates Made                          | Notes                                       |
|------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `src/`     | Minor cleanup in `command.c` and `main.c` | Removed debug prints, added `leds_off()` safety |
| `minutes/` | `minutes_17_4.txt` created              | Final testing session and outcomes logged   |
| `README.md`| Updated modules, testing plans, and diagram | Ready for Week 8 submission and demo        |

## 4. What Now Works End-to-End

- Full input pipeline: user → UART → buffer → parser → command module
- Command logic routes cleanly to timer and LED modules
- Interrupt-safe operation confirmed (no race conditions observed)
- Final timer precision within expected bounds
- All team members completed assigned testing and merged changes

---

## 5. Group Reflections

- Clear modular separation improved traceability and fixes
- Integration testing helped uncover subtle timing and debounce issues
- Documenting command paths in the coding diagram simplified debugging
- Codebase now demo-ready, aligned with project spec
